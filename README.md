# dotfiles
This repository contains the dotfiles of my three PC setups:
- **Desktop (primary):** Endeavour OS (Arch) on KDE Plasma (Wayland)
- **Thinkpad Z13 (Laptop, secondary):** Endeavour OS (Arch) on Hyprland (Wayland)
- **Thinkpad T430 (Laptop, old):** Arch on i3 (X.org)

Each directory contains another README with more information, including a list of packages I install.

**Why Endeavour OS?**  
I like Arch and the AUR, but installing it for the n-th time gets old.  
EOS makes installing a breeze, adds a few nifty features (like auto refreshing package mirrors & installing yay) but still retains the Arch experience and grants access to the AUR.

**Specs:**  
You can see a list of my up-to-date specs in my Gist [here](https://gist.github.com/3urobeat/d8bf8c3e538b78db31cbf0f16a18ccba).
